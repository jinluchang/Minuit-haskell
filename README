This is a Haskell binding for Minuit2 C++ library which is part of the
ROOT system.

It should be noted that this binding only provide limited access of
Minuit2 library, thus it perhaps is not suitable for productive use.

The binding mainly contains two component:

1. C binding to Minuit2. (minuit-c.h, minuit-c.cc)

2. Haskell binding build on top of the C binding. (Minuit.hs)
